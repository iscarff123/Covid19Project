# Covid-19 Dashboard Project
### Time of Project: Summer 2020
### Practicum Project
### Masters of Science in Data Analytics, UTSA

For this project, I was tasked to build a dashboard for visualizing data related to Covid-19 in the United States. Specifically, I performed the following:

* Collected, consolidated, and filtered data related to COVID-19 from available sources.
* Generated trend graphs nationally, by state, and by county based on consolidated data. Associated mobility data with the growth of cases and deaths based on mobility data provided by Google. In addition, reported case and death rates by gender and race, and hospitalization rate.
* Created data visualization dashboard using Dash Plotly, allowing easy, interactive visualization to help decision making.

What made this dashboard unique (at the time) was that one could compare case numbers with community mobility. Please see the [Covid-19 Dashboard Summary.docx](https://github.com/iscarff123/Covid19Project/raw/master/Covid-19%20Dashboard%20Summary.docx) file for more details about the dashboard. Below are some screenshots of the dashboard structure and various reports.
